## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Deployed to Github Pages

### What I learned

Although a 'newbie' design structure, I learned a lot during this project.

Still working through the basics of TailwindCSS, I wanted to focus on just Tailwind and decided to structure the website with no frontend framework (React). The functionality was simple enough to get by with a few lines of Javascript to validate the form input from the user.

```js
form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  form.email.addEventListener('click', () => {
    error.classList.add('hidden');
  });

  if (!form.email.value) {
    error.classList.remove('hidden');
  }

  if (!form.email.value.includes('@')) {
    error.classList.remove('hidden');
  }
});
```

The hardest challenge was the structuring of the document with Tailwind. Tailwind is extremely nice to use and adds a lot of ease but ensuring the design matched multiple design methods was a bit challenging. One thing I know I should have done more efficently was to write out the designs and lay out my 'foundations' before putting code to editor. Since I did not do this effectively, I believe I added some unnecessary work arounds to get the responsive design of the webpage.

I do love how Tailwind implements responsive design (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) and I can see how in the future and through practice, Tailwind will be an extreme asset and tool in my design practice.
